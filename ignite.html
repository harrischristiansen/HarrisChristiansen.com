	<p>Hi,</p>
	
	<p>Purdue Computer Science needs an awesome mentorship program that will provide significant, quality growth to our community, and be the highlight of students Computer Science careers. The Ignite mentorship program aims to create a unique one-on-one mentorship connection between freshmen and enthusiastic, knowledgeable upperclassmen, as well as teach and push those students to create stunning projects. Students will receive a substantial advancement in the community, enabling them to do well in and out of class, and prepare themselves for the best internships.</p>

	<p>Next semester, Fall 2015, Purdue Hackers will be starting the Ignite mentorship program! We are looking for people who have highly developed skills and would make for good mentors, and we have identified you as a potential candidate. The commitment would include one-on-one time with your paired freshman student each week (at least an hour), and then a 1 hour meet-up with everyone every three weeks, for the length of the semester.</p>

	<p>We will be conducting interviews (20 mins) for Ignite next week (April 20-24th) If you are interested in being a part of this new mentorship program, please indicate your availability by filling out the linked form. If you have any questions about the program, reply to this email and I’ll be sure to answer them.</p>
